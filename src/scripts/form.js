//  ContactForm component that, when filled out and a submit button is pressed, adds a new contact to storage.
// It should import the ContactCollection component.

import collection from "./collection.js"

const form = {

}

export default form;





// This module will build a form and append it to the DOM. The form will contain input fields for a user to add a new food to their refrigerator and a button with an event listener that will listen for the click
// 1. Build HTML form
// 2. Attach event listener to button in form
// 3. Append the HTML form to the DOM

// This module will also contain the function that executes when the button in the form is clicked. When the button in the form is clicked, the following will happen:
// 1. Get user input that user entered
// 2. Create a new object with the same structure we have been using throughout the application to represent a food item:
// {
//   name: "user input name",
//   expiration: "user input expiration",
//   type: "user input type"
// }
// 3. Call the method(postNewFood) with the fetch request to POST to the API and pass it the object we created in the previous step
